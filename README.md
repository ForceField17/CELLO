## Introduction
Cancer EvoLution for LOngitudinal data (CELLO) is a MATLAB toolbox for comprehensive analysis of longitudinal genomic sequencing data in cancer. It was originally developed by Jiguang Wang [1,2], and the implementation has both MATLAB and R version:
* [MATLAB](./CELLOM.md)
* [R](./CELLOR.md)

## Datasets

The input [SAVI report](./input.savi.txt) consists of a list of genetic variants from 90 glioblastoma patients.
